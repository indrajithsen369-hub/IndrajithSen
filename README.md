Stocks Profit/Loss Calculator
An Application to Calculate the profit or loss for stocks

Overview of the Project :
This project is a simple command-line based Stock Profit/Loss Calculator designed to help users determine the financial outcome of a stock transaction. The program allows the user to input key values such as the buying price, selling price, and number of shares, and then computes whether the result is a profit, loss, or no gain. To ensure accuracy and prevent incorrect entries, the system includes safe input validation using try–except blocks, which repeatedly prompt the user until valid numerical data is provided. The logic is implemented using basic arithmetic operations and conditional statements to evaluate the difference between cost and selling values. Overall, the project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including modular function design, user interaction, error handling, and decision-making, making it suitable for beginners learning Python and command-line application development.

Features : 
	•	The system allows users to input the buying price, selling price, and number of shares to calculate the financial outcome of a stock transaction.
	•	It includes secure input handling using validation to ensure only positive and valid numerical values are accepted.
	•	The program automatically determines whether the result is a profit, a loss, or no gain based on the difference between the buying and selling values.
	•	It displays clear and user-friendly output, informing the user of the final result of the transaction.
	•	The implementation follows a modular structure by using a separate function to collect and validate input, improving readability and maintainability.
	•	The application runs entirely through a command-line interface, making it lightweight and platform-independent.
	•	Error handling prevents the program from crashing due to incorrect input and ensures a smooth user experience.

  Technologies/tools used :
  This project is developed using the Python programming language, which serves as the core technology for implementing the logic, input validation, and calculation of stock profit or loss. The program is executed through a command-line interface (CLI), allowing it to run on any operating system without requiring additional graphical components. A basic text editor or IDE such as VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE is used for writing and editing the source code to ensure proper formatting and readability. The project can optionally utilize version control tools like Git to manage code changes and maintain development history. Python’s built-in functions and standard library are used throughout the implementation, eliminating the need for external dependencies and keeping the application lightweight and easy to run.

Steps to install & run the project:
  To run the stock profit/loss calculator application, the user must first ensure that Python is installed on their system by downloading it from the official Python website and verifying the installation using the terminal command python --version or python3 --version. After installation, a new project folder should be created, and a Python file named stock_calculator.py must be added to it containing the provided program code. Once the file is saved, the user should open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory using the cd command, and execute the program by entering python stock_calculator.py or python3 stock_calculator.py depending on the system configuration. During execution, the application will prompt the user to input the buying price, selling price, and number of shares, after which the system will calculate and display whether the transaction results in a profit, loss, or no gain. If version control is required, the project folder can optionally be initialized using Git by running git init, followed by git add and git commit commands to store the initial version of the project.

Instructions for testing:
  To test the stock profit and loss calculator application, the user should begin by running the program and verifying that the menu options display correctly, after which different input combinations must be entered such as valid positive values, zero values, and negative or non-numeric inputs to confirm that the validation logic correctly rejects invalid entries and accepts only valid numeric data; the calculator should then be tested with scenarios that produce profit, loss, and break-even outcomes to ensure accurate financial calculations and correct message display; the transaction history feature must also be checked by performing multiple calculations and then selecting the “View Transaction History” option to verify that all records are stored properly in the CSV file and retrieved without errors; additionally, the application should be tested by intentionally providing incorrect menu choices to confirm that appropriate error messages appear, and finally the log file should be reviewed to ensure that each transaction and system activity is recorded successfully, confirming that both functional behavior and reliability expectations are met.
